                    <p id="paragraph">I'm a first-year at Harvard College studying computer science, physics, and politics. I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life and still enjoy my late night bike rides, games of Risk, and playing music. I also love pop, cooking with my friends, and hosting dinner parties (pre-covid of course). 
                        <br><br><br>While I love to code, my passion for environmental activism had led me to interesting intersections in the fields of computer science and public service. I've interned at NASA working on satellite mapping, conducted research with Harvard's Earth & Planetary Science department, and have even written multiple times for Teen Vogue about my experience with political volunteering. More locally, I founded CASA Youth, an advisory board to our city council in environmental policy, where we drafted the AUSD Declaration of Climate Emergency. 
                        <br><br><br>I'm proud to be part of the nation-wide Kode With Klossy, NCWIT, and #BuiltByGirls communities. I hope to make a career around public technology and international relations.  
                        <br><br><br>Being a student and second-generation immigrant in San Francisco, I am blessed with diverse interactions and fresh perspective.
