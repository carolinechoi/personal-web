                    <p id="paragraph">I'm an undergrad at Harvard College studying computer science and government. I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life (and am subsequently despising Boston weather). I enjoy late night bike rides, hiking, and playing music at the beach. I also love bedroom pop, cooking with my friends, and hosting fancy soirees. 
                        <br><br><br>While I love to code, my passion for environmental activism had led me to interesting intersections in the fields of computer science and public service. I've interned at NASA working on satellite mapping, conducted research with Harvard's Earth & Planetary Science department, and write for Teen Vogue's politics section about my experience with politics. More locally, I founded CASA Youth, an advisory board to our city council in environmental policy, where we drafted the AUSD Declaration of Climate Emergency and helped pass the city's Climate and Resiliency Plan (CARP). 
                        <br><br><br>I'm proud to be part of the nation-wide Kode With Klossy, NCWIT, and #BuiltByGirls communities. I hope to make a career around public technology and international relations.
